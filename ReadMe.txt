search algorithms: linear search, binary search
sort algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort
time complexity: O(n) for linear search, O(log n) for binary search, O(n^2) for bubble sort, O(n log n) for quick sort
input: number of elements in the list, elements, algorithm type, search/sort algorithm, value to search
output: search result, sorted list, running time, time complexity
running time: O(n) for linear search, O(log n) for binary search, O(n^2) for bubble sort, O(n log n) for quick sort
example: 5 3 1 4 2 5 1 2
